                    <p>From the RPN website: Local representative involvement is essential for effective implementation of conservation programs and to minimize program duplication. RPN knows that our targeted conservation goals canâ€™t be achieved unless local people themselves want to get involved and take responsibility.<br><br>This can be achieved through coordination and collaboration with local government.
                    <br><br>The Panchthar-Ilam-Taplejung (PIT) Red Panda Protected Forest is a network of Community Forests (not federally protected) that are managed by local Community Forest User Groups (CFUGs), District Forest Offices (DFOs) and municipalities. These forests are also threatened by deforestation and habitat degradation. <br><br>Support at local level government and policy levels is critical to the conservation of this important area.
                    RPN works with CFUGs in adopting red panda conservation measures into their operational plans in the PIT Protected Forest!
                    <br><br>They are also involved in Research and Monitoring, Education and Outreach, Anti-Poaching, and sustainable livelihoods.
